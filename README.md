# Endogenous Bank Distribution

This code simulates results of the model I developed during my dissertation. 

It concerns the trade-off banks face between liquidity provision on the liability side and increasing investment returns/relationship banking on the asset side. The former is heavily influenced by the work of  Dang et al. (2017)¹ where liquidity is guaranteed by opacity. In this model, the bank of Dang et al. is expanded from a single project to a portfolio of projects. Correlation is thus important as it turns the portfolio less opaque/ less informationally costly. Thus, if relationship banking gives higher correlation between investments but at the same time higher returns, a trade-off surges.

From this point, an heterogeneous distribution of searching costs on projects can explain market fragmentation. Also, the model has a natural tendency to form smaller banks with high levels of relationship banking and the opposite for the bigger ones. This result can be a new explanation of a stylized fact that is still not really understood.

Any suggestion/question about the model and the simulation, you can contact me: gustavo.moher@hotmail.com
